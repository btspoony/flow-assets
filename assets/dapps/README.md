# dApp Assets

This directory contains logo assets for decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Flow blockchain.

## Directory Structure

-   `svg/` - SVG format dApp logos
-   `png/` - PNG format dApp logos (256x256px recommended)

## Naming Convention

Use the application name in kebab-case:

-   `my-dapp-name.svg`
-   `flow-port.png`
-   `nft-marketplace.svg`

## Adding a New dApp

1. Prepare both SVG and PNG versions of the dApp logo if possible
2. The PNG should be 256x256 pixels with a transparent background
3. Name files according to the kebab-case convention above
4. Place the files in their respective format directories
5. Ensure you have the rights to submit the logo

## Special Requirements

-   For official dApps, please ensure the logo matches the official branding
-   Please include a small text file with the same name as your logo (e.g., `my-dapp-name.txt`) that includes:
    -   Official dApp name
    -   Brief description (1-2 sentences)
    -   Website URL
    -   Social media links (optional)
