# Token Assets

This directory contains logo assets for tokens on the Flow blockchain.

## Directory Structure

Each token should have its own folder, with logo files placed in format-specific subfolders:

```bash
tokenname/png/logo.png
tokenname/svg/logo.svg
```

-   `svg/` - SVG format token logos
-   `png/` - PNG format token logos (256x256px recommended)

## Naming Convention

Use simple, non-descriptive filenames for logos and ensure the logo is in the right folder:

`logo.svg`
`logo.png`

## Adding a New Token

1. Prepare both SVG and PNG versions of the token logo if possible
2. The PNG should be 256x256 pixels with a transparent background
3. Name files according to the convention above
4. Place the files in their respective token folder
5. Ensure you have the rights to the logo before submitting

## Special Requirements

-   For official Flow tokens, please ensure the logo matches the official branding
-   For community tokens, please provide verification that you are authorized to submit the logo
